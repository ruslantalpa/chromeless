The issue tracker is only for bug reports or feature requests.

1. If you have a question and not a bug/feature request please ask it on StackOverflow here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=chromeless
    Non-bug/feature request issues will be closed. The reason for this is that, the issue tracker can quickly become filled up with requests-for-help which becomes difficult (and overwhelming) for project collaborators to manage.
2. Please search for and check if an issue already exists so there are no duplicates
3. Check out and follow our Guidelines: https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
4. Fill out the whole template so we have a good overview on the issue
5. Do not remove any section of the template. If something is not applicable leave it empty but leave it in the Issue
6. Please follow the template, otherwise we'll have to ask you to update it
